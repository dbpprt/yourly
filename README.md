## Motivation 🤔

I read the same pages every morning and so far I have not found a good news reader and always fall back to use chrome at the end of the day. There are many articles that I temporarily store and read in the office, for example. So I built yourly - a very simple news reader for my favorite platforms including options to store articles.

(and I wanted to dig into flutter 🤓)

## Features 👍

- Supports Ycombinator news, Github Trending (+ C#, + Dart)
- Long press to open the article in-app
- Double tap to archive the article
- Tap to open in the default browser
- Timeline: double tap open the action menu (share, remove)
- Infinity scroll
- Pull to refresh
- This project shows the power of Azure DevOps which is used for CI / CD
- Builds are currently distributed for Android only on Visual Studio App Center

## Roadmap 🚧

- Implement search functionality
- Display the timeline as a real timeline (grouped by day)
- Make tabs configurable
- Push to PlayStore
- ~~Implement CI builds~~
- Add a release to GitHub releases
- Simple web interface to access all saved articles
- ~~(basic understanding how flutter works)~~

## Warning ⚠️

I primarily started this project to learn about flutter and built it last night in a few hours so the code-quality might not be the best.
